What i wanted from the project
- Something that could send a sms or other kind of notifikation with a image of a cute bunny and either some random qoute, motivational text or cute message either on the image or as a notification text
- I also wanted to learn more about php, how do you program in php, how does a php project look like, how do i import stuff that sort of thing
- I want to rely less on AI that does not mean i don thave to use it i just have to use it differently. Instead of "give me the code for making this work" i hope i instead learn more about how to find answers on my come or read documentation.

First how does PHP look?
- Weird variables, Weird foreach loops compared to python and c#

How do i even run php code?
- Downloaded a binary, setup Path in enviroment variables
- Other times i could just run a installer (like with pytohn, or java, or c#)
- I initially downloaded the sorce code instead of the binary and wondered why it was not working. I found it frustrating at the time but in hindsight it wasn't that difficult. 
- I was close to trying to download a complete package, but i really wanted to just get php to work and later worry about a webserver

First Hurdle, how do i get images?
- I since i can just good cute bunny and looks up images then it should have been easy, but that stuff is rendered with JS and therefore more annoying for a webscraper to find?
- Then i found out about image search api's and just picked bing, why? because google required me to go through a whole process i tried that but didn't know how to find documentation and quit midway then i had to do the same thing with microsoft but this time i just accepted that fact
- I have not yet tried but want to try to use something like sellenium and see if i can get it to work that way without needing to require api keys and worry about rate limiting

How do i use a libary?
- So after playing a bit around with the bing image searcher i wanted to setup a repo, but i could not just have the api key hard coded. I have before in python used a .env file that is not tracked by git. But inorder to get this to work i found out that i had to install and use a libary. This being https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv
- But how do i install, in python i have pip, in c# i could use a gui tool to manage NuGet packages.
- Here i learend about composer which is just pip but instead of installing globally it installs locally. I worried a lot about installing libaries because i found that process in java very hard and werid. But with composer it was very easy


I revisted how to get a image because i didn't understand all that was needed for the file_get_contents. I found that there is a libary https://docs.guzzlephp.org/ that is basically the same as request in python
I tried to do that and imidiatly ran into a problem
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught GuzzleHttp\Exception\RequestException: cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
what did i have to do to fix it. I had to go into the php.ini file and change a value in there to a cert i downloaded from here https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html


I wanted to convert all images from the bing api result to jpg. But in the end that was too challenging and i just went with the simple solution to make sure the img was a jpg in the first place
